"Start is called before the first frame Update"

If you're tired of reading this comment, this repository provides templates for common C# classes.
You can include it into your project e.g. as a git submodule as follows:

```git submodule add git@github.com:InflamedGums/unity-script-templates.git Assets/ScriptTemplates```

The target directory 'Assets/ScriptTemplates' is important for the unity editor to recognize the new templates. After restarting the editor, the script templates are available via the contex menu:

```Create -> Unity Templates```
